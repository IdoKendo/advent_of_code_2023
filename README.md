# Advent Of Code

[Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023) is an event of programming puzzles, more info can be found in the about section of the site!

I am participating in the 2023 event casually, using Go since I want to get better at it! I created this repo to store my solutions.

Let me know if I did something inefficient, or I could've done something better, I want to learn!

# My Scores

These are times and ranks for the days I've completed:

The times are time since the puzzle was posted, not since I started solving.
